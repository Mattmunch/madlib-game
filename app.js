<p id="madlib">Today I went to the zoo. I saw a <span id="adjectiveOne"></span>
        <span id="nounOne"></span> jumping up and down in its tree. He
        <span id="verbOne"></span>. <span id="adverbOne"></span> through
        the large tunnel that led to its <span id="adjectiveTwo"></span>
        <span id="nounTwo"></span>. I got some peanuts and passed them
        through the cage to a gigantic gray <span id="nounThree"></span>
        towering above my head. Feeding that animal made me
        hungry. I went to get a <span id="adjectiveThree"></span> scoop of ice
        cream. It filled my stomach. Afterwards I had to
        <span id="verbTwo"></span> <span id="adverbTwo"></span> to catch our bus. When
        I got home I <span id="verbThree"></span> my mom for a
        <span id="adjectiveFour"></span> day at the zoo.</p>
